# ScreenGuard - FRONT END

## Project Overview
The ScreenGuard frontend is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that enables parents to search YouTube videos, curate approved content, and manage a safe video library for children. Due to time constraints, the current implementation focuses on core video management functionality without full authentication.
