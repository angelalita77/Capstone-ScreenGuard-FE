# üõ°Ô∏è ScreenGuard - FRONT END

## üìã Project Overview
The ScreenGuard frontend is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that enables parents to search YouTube videos, curate approved content, and manage a safe video library for children. Due to time constraints, the current implementation focuses on core video management functionality without full authentication.

## ‚ú® Features
- YouTube Video Search - Search and preview YouTube videos using the YouTube Data API
- Approval System - Add videos to your approved library with a single click
- Dashboard Management - View, update, and delete videos from your approved collection
- Kid-Friendly Interface - Clean, simple approved videos page for children to browse
- Video Editing - Customize video titles to make them more appropriate or descriptive
- Direct YouTube Links - Watch approved videos directly on YouTube with one click
